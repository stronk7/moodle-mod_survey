-> does it make sense the research per long text?
-> "Manage relation" page has lots of features, but the consequence is that the page is
"cluttered" with too many settings. Obviously a Show/Hide advanced
button is needed. (thanks to JR)
-> The Autofill question message "Content will be added at submit time" should not be displayed to the Student when taking the Survey, as it does not mean anything to him. That is a message for Teacher, not Student. (thanks to JR)
-> grades?
-> survey_get_view_actions()?
-> survey_get_post_actions()?
-> survey_scale_used($surveyid, $scaleid)?
-> survey_scale_used_anywhere($scaleid)?
-> unit test (they are a must)
-> *** Crucial known issue that is not fixable in my opinion. I apply a master template. I make a survey with it. Tomorrow I update the master template with a newer version. This new version has one more item in the middle. Surveys build with the old release of the plugin will stop working fine as they will find in the right position string of a different template.
-> possible better solution: use the first 32 chars of the question escaped
-> is the autofill field saved to userdata even if it is not shown?
-> allow upperbound date/datetime == to now
-> the option "not answered" is missing in the search form even if a "Answer not provided" is part of an item
-> the workaround suggested by Marina Glancy in MDL-42946 doesn't work if the label is crafted into the tag <p>.
-> I need a regex to validate an url
-> mform elements in MMM have different sizes probably because of /theme/yui_combo.php?3.13.0/cssreset/cssreset.css&3.13.0/cssfonts/cssfonts.css&3.13.0/cssgrids/cssgrids.css&3.13.0/cssbase/cssbase.css


> 1) ELOY - IN PROGRESS: While looking for DB columns in the DB I found all the install.xml strangely formatted. And also, built with some old version of the editor (we are PREV/NEXT free since some months ago). Custom formatting continues there. It’s not the end of the world, so keeping it for now.

...and I feel, it can be closed. Am I wrong?

> 2) DONE: reviewing 1) will also review this. Some indexes in those files should be defined as foreign keys.

...can I delete it from the list?

> 3) DANIELE to provide a huge example with all branching/options exposed: Creating some items I discovered that they content was being stored into item->content (missing format) instead of survey_textarea

Last revision of parent-child_rev7.xml reday to be imported as usertemplate is here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/32667040/parent-child_rev7.xml You may like to test it in order to have material to discuss many aspects of survey.

> 4) The field/format subplugin duality... is tricky. Perhaps it would be better to make all them fileds (with/without accepting responses).

As already discussed, the only difference is that I store them into two different folders. Why do you suggest to put them all into the same folder? Is not this going to increase the confusion?

My point is… what’s the real difference between a field and a format subplugin? Form my understanding it’s just an “attribute” difference. Anyway, not critical.

> 5) Still it seems to be something strange when handling fileareas. I just grepped by get_area_files and found a bunch of them new/strange for me. ELOY has to review this!

Please let me know better what do you mean. I can not understand it.

6) Comments in italian.

7) Done: The way an "attempt" is started (especially when the student has already filled a previous one is strange. DANIELE fixed this.

8) Some settings, like the max/min year sound strange in the module.

9) More coming, for sure.

must:

MDL-25067: Not able to disable the editor
MDL-31796: $mform->disabledIf doesn't work for 'filemanager' mform elements.
MDL-43689: Adv. check box not returning actual level but default one.
MDL-43704: multiselect not disabled by checkbox

may:

MDL-28194: I am in trouble assigning syles to some mform element.
MDL-34815: Disabled mform items need to be skipped during validation (and more).

things like the "phantom tabs" (sorry for the expression, lol, just joking) or the way "attempts" are performed... are substandard (to name it in some way).

10) A read me about what's missing (backup, migration from old, usability review and discussion)

11) A commit (decided by you) where you want me to cut history. Can be current commit of anything else if you want to preserve your latest commits for any reason.

12) A BIG WARNING saying that it must not be used in production sites with existing old surveys because they will be erased completely (beacuse of 1).
README.md (so it will display nicely in github) ?

13) Delete any other todo and similar.

14) start using the tracker for issues, lol.

15) start using proper commit messages with tracker issues always
(headbang)
we can do that toady, np, here. what do you think?

16) Add support for generators + acceptance & unit tests.

17) Attempts / responses. How should we name those things?

18) surveyfield_integer_maxnuminteger defaults to 105 (copy/pasted from age?)

19) Anything else annotated in https://github.com/kordan/moodle-mod_survey/blob/master/state_of_art_*** files.

20) Discuss how to get advantages by MDL-41767 fix.
