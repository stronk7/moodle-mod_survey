-> The Autofill question message "Content will be added at submit time" should not be displayed to the Student when taking the Survey, as it does not mean anything to him. That is a message for Teacher, not Student. (thanks to JR)
-> grades?
-> survey_get_view_actions()?
-> survey_get_post_actions()?
-> survey_get_editor_options()?
-> survey_scale_used($surveyid, $scaleid)?
-> survey_scale_used_anywhere($scaleid)?
-> in the search form one more option should be added to each item to search for "no answer"
-> unit test (they are a must)
-> *** Crucial known issue that is not fixable in my opinion. I apply a master template. I make a survey with it. Tomorrow I update the master template with a newer version. This new version has one more item in the middle. Surveys build with the old release of the plugin will stop working fine as they will find in the right position string of a different template.
