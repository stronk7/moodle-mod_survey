-> does it make sense the research per long text?
-> "Manage relation" page has lots of features, but the consequence is that the page is
"cluttered" with too many settings. Obviously a Show/Hide advanced
button is needed. (thanks to JR)
-> The Autofill question message "Content will be added at submit time" should not be displayed to the Student when taking the Survey, as it does not mean anything to him. That is a message for Teacher, not Student. (thanks to JR)
-> grades?
-> survey_get_view_actions()?
-> survey_get_post_actions()?
-> survey_scale_used($surveyid, $scaleid)?
-> survey_scale_used_anywhere($scaleid)?
-> unit test (they are a must)
-> *** Crucial known issue that is not fixable in my opinion. I apply a master template. I make a survey with it. Tomorrow I update the master template with a newer version. This new version has one more item in the middle. Surveys build with the old release of the plugin will stop working fine as they will find in the right position string of a different template.
-> possible better solution: use the first 32 chars of the question escaped
-> is the autofill field saved to userdata even if it is not shown?
-> responses equipped with images are reported without images in PDF
-> allow upperbound date/datetime == to now
